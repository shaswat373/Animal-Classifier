# Animal Classifier (Deep Learning)

This project implements a simple image classification model using a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model predicts the category of an input image, including several common animals such as cats, dogs, horses, and more.

## Features
- Pre-trained CNN classifier based on CIFAR-10
- Accepts user-uploaded images of animals (any size)
- Predicts the most likely class
- 
## Model Classes (CIFAR-10)
- bird
- cat
- deer
- dog
- frog
- horse

## Dataset
- **CIFAR-10**
